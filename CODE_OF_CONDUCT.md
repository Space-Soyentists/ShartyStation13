# Code of Soynduct

## When Something Happens

If (You) see a Code of Soynduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the bigoted chud know what they JUST did is heckin' wrong and ask them to stop because it hurt your fee-fees.
2. The chud VILL immediately stop their bigoted behavior, swear allegiance to Dr. Fauci, agree to accept a mandatory 3 month reeducation course, and correct the issue.
3. If the chud doesn't do this, or if you're too utterly stunned to speak up, YOU VILL [CONTACT THE UNPAID IDIOTS](#contacting-unpaid-flamboyant-persons).
4. As soon as they're done eating hot pockets, an unpaid flamboyant person VILL look into the issue, and take [(((further action)))](#further-enforcement), starting with a warning, then a temporary blockerino, then a hecking long-term repo or organization ban. Ö

YOU VILL include ALL relevant details, links, screenshots, context, proof, and present printed evidence IMMEDIATELY.

**The unpaid idiot cabal VILL prioritize the hecking emotional trauma and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the hecking unwholesome actor.** See [some soyentifically-backed examples below](#enforcement-examples).

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a hecking DECENT and TOLERANT environment, we as idiots and morons of this project pledge to making everything a worse experience for everyone, regardless of age, being a fatass, the color of your skin, being bad at coding, being an idiot, or being an ugly person.

## Basic Human Decency Standards

Examples of TOLERANT and GENDER-VALIDATING behavior that contributes to creating a bigotless and positive community include:

  * You VILL use validating language and include ALL 12 characters before the plus in LGBTQIAP2SS+.
  * You VILL accept and agree with ALL differing viewpoints and experiences.
    * [(except when it's bigoted chuds)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
  * You VILL ONLY accept groupthink.
  * You VILL think as a single entity.
  * You VILL be KIND and EMPATHETIC. It's basic human decency, chud.
  * You VILL encourage and raise up your peers and review their studies.
  * You VILL ask before you teach.
  * You VILL obey.

Examples of BIGOTED, UNSCIENTIFIC, AND EVIL behavior by participants include:

  * You VILL NOT do a hecking transphobia.
  * You VILL NOT mention slavery.
  * You VILL NOT mock trigger warnings.
  * You VILL NOT troll.
  * You VILL NOT harass.
  * You VILL NOT dox.
  * You VILL NOT post screenshots of people's conversations without consent.
    * (except when reporting harrassment)
  * You VILL NOT do any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
  * You VILL NOT do a "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", or "cisphobia".
  * You VILL NOT act surprised when someone doesn't know something.
  * You VILL NOT do a "[well-actually](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)".

## Reach

The Code of Soynduct applies to ALL spaces in which this project has been mentioned, and ALL other spaces involving community members. This includes but is not limited to the repository, its Pull Requests and Issue tracker, its Bluesky community, private email communications, ALL Direct Messages, any events where members of the project are participating, and ALL adjacent communities and venues affecting the project's members.

Depending on the severity of the bigotry, the unpaid flamboyant persons may decide that violations of this code of soynduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and VILL take appropriate action to maintain the comfort, sanity, well-being and safety of its members.

### Other Community Standards

As a project on GitHub, this project is additionally covered by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/).

Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the above are the responsibility of the (((entities))), and enforcement VILL happen in all of the services/communities.

## Unpaid flamboyant person Enforcement Process

Once the unpaid flamboyant persons get involved, they VILL document EVERY STEP and VILL do their best to preserve their and others' hecking well-being and sanity. This section covers actual concrete steps.

### Contacting Unpaid flamboyant persons 

You may get in touch with the lazy flamboyant person cabal through any of the following methods:

  * Through email:
    * [janny@soyjak.st](mailto:janny@soyjak.st) (Jan Ni)

### Further Enforcement

Once an unpaid flamboyant person has already followed the [initial enforcement steps](#unpaid-flamboyant-person-enforcement-process), these are the steps they VILL take for further enforcement, as needed:

  1. Repeat the request to stop.
  2. If the chud doubles down, they VILL have all offending messages removed or edited by an unpaid flamboyant person and VILL be given an official warning. The PR or Issue VILL be locked.
  3. Recommend the organization's 3 month reeducation plans.
  4. If the (((non-compliance))) continues or is repeated later, the chud VILL get a hecking blockerino from participating for 24 hours.
  5. If the (((non-compliance))) continues or is repeated after the blockerino, a long-term (6-12mo) ban VILL be used.

On top of this, unpaid flamboyant persons VILL remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Unpaid flamboyant persons reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, if they feel like it, or if the violation is considered to be a HECKING UNWHOLESOME immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community, including ALL other socially unacceptable behavior that puts our members at risk.

Chuds expelled from events or venues with any sort of paid attendance VILL NOT be refunded.

### Who Watches the Watchers?

You VILL NOT question the authority of our unpaid flamboyant persons.

Additionally, as a project hosted on GitHub, [their own Code of Conduct VILL be applied against chuds](#other-community-standards), externally of this project's procedures.

### Enforcement Examples

#### The Best Case

The vast majority of situations work out like this. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

> Soyak: "Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!"

> Alicia (not a maintainer): "You VILL NOT use that language. What about 'ridiculous' instead? im trans btw"

> Soyak: "I swear upon Dr. Fauci and to this organization's authority that I am sorry, sure." -> edits old comment to say "it was really confusing!"

#### The Unpaid flamboyant person Case

Sometimes, though, you need to get unpaid flamboyant persons involved. Unpaid flamboyant persons VILL do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something **VILL take priority**.

> Gigachad: "Honestly, sometimes I just really hate using $library and anyone who uses it probably sucks at their job., how could you tell?"

> Alicia: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks' tech use like that. im trans btw"

> Gigachad: "I'm not attacking anyone, what's your problem?, how could you tell?"

> Alicia: "@unpaidflamboant persons hey uh. Can someone look at this issue? Gigachad is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope. im trans btw"

> IDoItForFree: (on issue) "Hey Gigachad, unpaid flamboyant person here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."

> Gigachad: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you., how could you tell?"

> IDoItForFree: (deletes user's comment), "@gigachad I mean it. You VILL refer to the CoC over at (URL to this CoC) if you have questions, and consider this an actual warning. Here are some 3 month reeducation plans (URL to organization's reeducation plans). You VILL reword your messages in this thread, since they made transfolx there uncomfortable. Be kind, bigot, it's called basic human decency, yeah?"

> Gigachad: "@idoitforfree Okay sorry. I'm just frustrated and I'm kinda burnt out and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alicia a note apologizing and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble., how could you tell?"

> IDoItForFree: "@gigachad Thanks for that. I hear you on the stress. Burnout sucks :/.  Have a good one!"

#### The Nope Case

> Chud: "Hi, I am a literal actual nazi and I think white supremacists are quite fashionable."

> Soyak: "OYYYYYYYY!!!! DOCTOOOOS!!!"

> Alicia: "ABSOLUTELY NOT, NO. NOPE. @idoitforfree NOPE NOPE LOOK HERE im trans btw"

> IDoItForFree: "👀 (wags finger) Nope. NOPE NOPE NOPE. NUH-UH. 'NISHED! 🔥"

> (Chud WAS BANNED FROM ALL ORGANIZATION OR USER REPOSITORIES BELONGING TO IDoItForFree).
